# NVDALinearLogisticAnalysis
This project is an exploration into trade signal generation, the general intent to provide insight into the relationships of the features and indicators of a stock, and use this to see if a price prediction model can be generated and power a logistic regression model that generates buy, sell, and hold signals. 

This project will be submitted for the DTSA 5509 Machine Learning Course, and within that project we will focus on the company NVidia and their stock NVDA over the prior year as of July 15th 2024 over 1 minutes increments. I have utilized python and Jupytr Notebook to create a tap into my API stream from Twelve Data to access the stock data, depositing the information into a MYSQL server hosted on one of my machines.
